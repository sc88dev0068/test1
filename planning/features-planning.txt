#colors for sections of the 3D model
    *seperate the ship model in Blender
	*export it as gltf
	
	
#user should right click on the section and change the color.
	colors - vertex colors 
	Why vertex-colors 
	multiple vertex-colors work even with multiple materials?
	performance??
	
	
	1. Assign vertex colors in blender and test it in three js
	2. Right click on the section and user should be able to change the vertex colors of a section
